  <p>Field-dependent, direction-dependent, and temperature-dependent magnetic properties of EuSn

   <sub>2</sub>. (A) Field-dependent magnetization for the two crystal orientations measured at 2 K where red balls and blue squares represent magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the 
   <span class="italic">c</span>-axis, respectively. (B) Magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature measured in an external field of μ
   <sub>0</sub>
   <span class="italic">H</span> = 500 Oe, both perpendicular (blue) and parallel (red) to the 
   <span class="italic">c</span>-axis. The inset shows the temperature-dependent inverse susceptibility, measured for different sample orientations. The green line is the Curie–Weiss fit to the high-temperature data.
