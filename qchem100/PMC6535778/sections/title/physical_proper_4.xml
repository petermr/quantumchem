 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DC magnetization data were measured from 2 to 300 K using a Quantum Design Dynacool Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS), equipped with a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) option. The magnetic susceptibility was defined as M/H, where the applied field was 500 Oe. Field-dependent magnetization data were collected at 2 K with magnetic field up to μ
